# Data Analysis Summary

**Data source:**  
My data was sourced from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov).

**Brief description:**  
I chose the VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Count data set.

**Research question:**  
My research question was “Which month had the highest count of drug overdose deaths?” The data focused mainly on the state death counts but had months included in the variables, 
so I thought it would be interesting to see which month had the highest death count amongst all the states.

**Target variable:**  
The target variable was **“months”**, and the key predictor features included **percent, state, year,** and **data value**.

**Data cleaning process:**  
During the data cleaning process, I removed any duplicate variables and added an ID so I could track which values I was analyzing.

**Training process:**  
During the training process, we used the default model without making any changes to the model evaluation.

**Model performance:**  
The model achieved a 51.522% accuracy, and potential improvements could involve adding more variables to increase the accuracy.
