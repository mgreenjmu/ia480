    "It covers essential techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connecting to a MongoDB database** to store and retrieve tweets.\n",
    "- **Extracting tweets** and converting them into a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "- **Creating a vector store** and uploading tweets for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Using file search** to analyze private datasets.\n",
    "- **Performing web search** to retrieve the latest public information.\n",
    "- **Utilizing stateful responses** to maintain conversation context.\n",
    "- **Combining file and web search** to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, users will be able to integrate OpenAI's Responses API for efficient data retrieval \n",
    "and analysis of structured and unstructured data."
